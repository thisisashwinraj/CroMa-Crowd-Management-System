# CroMa - Crowd Management Software
CroMa is an android application that uses a python backend hardware, built on raspberry pi integrated with a firebase real-time database, and flutter framework for efficient crowd management in public transports such as buses & taxies. The hardware is effectively a handheld ticketing machine used for printing tickets, and collecting selective information about passengers. After algorithmic processings, the mobile application displays the output to the users. No login required.
