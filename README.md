# CroMa - Crowd Management Software
CroMa is an android application that uses a python backend hardware, built on raspberry pi integrated with a firebase real-time database, and flutter framework for efficient crowd management in public transports such as buses & taxies. The hardware is effectively a handheld ticketing machine used for printing tickets, and collecting selective information about passengers. After data processings, the mobile application displays the output to the users. No LogIns required.

The project development started in April 2022 as a group project and has been licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution - Non Commercial - No Derivs License (CC-BY-NC-ND).
